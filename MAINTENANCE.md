# Maintenance

## Background

Maintained fork: `0xble/CLIProxyAPI` of `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`.
Both default branches are `main`. Canonical checkout: `~/Repos/CLIProxyAPI`.
Initial local, `origin/main`, and `upstream/main` baseline on 2026-09-13:
`44e62bc8acc2f224bff9c62d222717d3f6723dea` (upstream v7.3.1), with exact parity.
Accepted upstream baseline before CPA-001: `d318bcc3afb9ea8782862f5e8cdb541afdc9dfa5` (`v8.0.23`).
`origin` publishes to the owned fork. `upstream` is fetch-only.
This fork supplies the local gateway build from fork `main` and tracks upstream RELEASE TAGS, not upstream `main`.

## Preserve

- Preserve upstream routing, credential refresh ownership, and protocol compatibility unless a separately accepted feature changes them.
- Keep credentials, account identities, quota snapshots, and live configuration outside this public repository.
- The dedicated `update-cliproxyapi` Hermes job owns synchronization and the authorized local installation. Other maintenance agents must not race that job.
- This fork intentionally diverges from upstream by removing the `agents-md-guard`, `auto-retarget-main-pr-to-dev`, and `pr-path-guard` workflows: fork PRs target `main`, while those guards closed or retargeted them. Re-check this divergence on each upstream tag merge.
- Install only published fork revisions using `cliproxyapi-install <full-sha>`. The installer verifies the active process, binary checksum, and provider inference and restores the previous release on failed activation.

## Active patches

### CPA-001 — request-scoped error cooldown duration

- Required behavior: an optional per-rule `cooldown` Go duration string (for example `1h`) on `request-scoped-errors` sets a minimum cooldown for `stop-and-cooldown` and `continue-and-cooldown` (it replaces the short transient cooldown and never shortens a longer status, provider, or quota deadline); absent `cooldown` preserves the existing behavior. Invalid durations ignore the rule.
- Source surfaces: `internal/config/config_types.go`, request-scoped rule normalization, `sdk/cliproxy/auth` result/cooldown handling, focused config and selection regressions, and the documented example config.
- Rationale: allow credential-specific upstream failures such as exhausted credit to remain unavailable for an explicit period while another credential serves requests. The implementation applies the deadline to the matched model's credential state; unrelated models on the same credential retain existing per-model behavior.
- Upstream source and feedback: closed issue https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/issues/3858; upstream contribution PR https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/pull/6496. Checked 2026-10-09; no released upstream implementation.
- Upstream disposition: proposed separately on `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI` against `dev`, with only the CPA-001 implementation and tests.
- Fork delivery: reviewed PR https://github.com/0xble/CLIProxyAPI/pull/11 targets `0xble/CLIProxyAPI:main` and also advances fork `main` to upstream release tag `v8.0.23` (`d318bcc3afb9ea8782862f5e8cdb541afdc9dfa5`).
- Focused regressions: `go test ./internal/config ./sdk/cliproxy/auth -run 'Test(ParseConfigRequestScopedErrors|ParseConfigOAuthRequestScopedErrors|SanitizeOAuthRequestScopedErrors|RequestScopedCooldown|RequestScopedErrors_)' -count=1`; full `go test ./...`; `go build -o /tmp/cliproxyapi-fork-check ./cmd/server`.
- Source rollback: revert the CPA-001 change through a new reviewed PR; runtime rollback remains a separate installation operation.
- Retirement condition: remove the fork implementation only after a released upstream version satisfies the complete cooldown regression contract.

No other behavioral patches are implemented or approved.
Use stable IDs `CPA-002` and onward for future logical patches.
Upstream maintenance-contract issue/PR associations: none found when checked 2026-09-13.
Retain this contract while maintaining the fork. Retire behavioral patches only after a released upstream implementation passes their complete regression contract.

## Update

Fetch `origin` and `upstream` separately and record exact SHAs. Reconcile with the latest upstream RELEASE TAG, retaining justified fork changes and checking current upstream feedback for every active patch.
Deliver changes through task branches and PRs targeting `0xble/CLIProxyAPI:main`, never the upstream repository by default.
Use targeted tests and inspect the fork-only diff. Before declaring synchronization current, fetch the selected upstream RELEASE TAG again and require that tag is an ancestor of fork `main`.
Keep patch records current when behavior or upstream disposition changes. Do not create recurring jobs from this contract.
For source rollback, revert the identified fork change through a new reviewed PR. Preserve source recovery refs before history changes. Runtime rollback is a separate deployment operation.

## Verify

Follow `AGENTS.md`. For Go changes run `gofmt`, relevant regressions, `go test ./...`, and `go build -o /tmp/cliproxyapi-fork-check ./cmd/server`.
For routing changes include weighted selection, session affinity, and quota failover fixtures under `sdk/cliproxy/auth` and `test`.
Documentation-only changes require diff inspection and a compile check. Runtime changes require real Codex Responses/tool-result and Claude Messages canaries in addition to source tests.
After publication verify local `main` equals `origin/main`, and the selected upstream RELEASE TAG is an ancestor of fork `main`.
Report source, publication, installation, and active runtime state separately. A maintenance run succeeds only after the published fork revision is active and verified. Preserve the prior release for rollback.

Baseline: `go test ./...` passes fully with no accepted failing tests. `TestOpenAICompatExecutorToolResultContentByInputModalities` was an accepted inherited failure from 2026-09-13 through the 2026-09-15 sync; it passes as of upstream `b773607e3e7756dc6020a291825e4eb08899595a` and is retired. Any test failure now blocks promotion. If a future inherited failure appears, reproduce it on an untouched upstream checkout first, record the exact test name and upstream SHA here, and report it separately only while unchanged-source proof, routing/quota tests, build, and live Codex/Claude canaries pass.
